## 📌 Overview

**JavaGrid4** is a turn-based strategy game where two players compete to claim cells on a dynamic grid. The game demonstrates professional-level Java development with modern UI/UX design, custom component rendering, and robust architecture patterns.

### 🎯 Why This Project Stands Out

- ✅ **Clean Architecture** - Strict separation of business logic and UI (MVC pattern)
- ✅ **Advanced Swing Components** - Custom-rendered components with Graphics2D
- ✅ **Multi-Screen Navigation** - Professional CardLayout implementation
- ✅ **Real-Time Validation** - Live user feedback with visual indicators
- ✅ **Design Patterns** - Observer, Strategy, Factory patterns throughout
- ✅ **Production-Ready Code** - Comprehensive error handling and validation

---

## 🎲 Game Rules

### Objective
**Claim the most cells** by strategically placing moves on the grid to reach the target value of 4.

### How to Play

1. **Choose Your Setup**
   - Select player names (up to 10 characters)
   - Pick unique colors for each player
   - Choose board size: **3×3** (Quick), **5×5** (Classic), or **7×7** (Expert)

2. **Gameplay Mechanics**
   - Players take turns clicking on any cell
   - When you click a cell, it **increments by 1** (0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4)
   - The **4 orthogonal neighbors** also increment by 1
   - When a cell reaches **value 4**, the current player **claims** it and earns **1 point**

3. **Winning Condition**
   - Game ends when **all cells reach value 4**
   - Player with the **most claimed cells wins**
   - Ties are possible!

### Strategy Tips 💡
- Plan ahead! Your move affects 5 cells (clicked + 4 neighbors)
- Corner cells have fewer neighbors = easier to control
- Watch your opponent's potential moves
- Sometimes letting your opponent go first is advantageous

## 🎯 Code Quality Highlights

### Clean Code Practices
```java
// Example: Pure business logic with zero UI dependencies
public class GameEngine {
    // NO Swing imports!
    public void applyMove(int row, int col, Player player) {
        // Increment clicked cell + 4 neighbors
        // Award points when cells reach 4
        // Maintain single responsibility
    }
}
```

### Custom Component Example
```java
// Example: Advanced Graphics2D rendering
public class ColorPickerButton extends JPanel {
    @Override
    protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) g.create();
        // Antialiasing, gradients, shadows, highlights
        // Professional 3D effect rendering
    }
}
```
